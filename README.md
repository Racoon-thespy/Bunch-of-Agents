Multi-Agent Systems with Google ADK

This repository contains implementations of uni-agent as well as multi-agent systems built using Google ADK.
The agents are designed with:

Stateful practices â†’ for maintaining context across sessions.

Asynchronous functions â†’ ensuring reduced latency, improved responsiveness, and smooth concurrent execution.

Deadlock prevention mechanisms â†’ to keep the systems reliable under multi-agent coordination.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Support for both single-agent and multi-agent workflows

âœ… Async execution for faster responses

âœ… Session management (stateful and in-memory options)

âœ… Built to be modular, extendable, and easy to integrate into larger systems
